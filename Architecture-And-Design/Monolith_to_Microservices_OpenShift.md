# Migrating a Monolith to Microservices on OpenShift

This guide outlines a strategic approach to decomposing a monolithic application into microservices and deploying them on OpenShift.

---

## 🧭 1. Assess the Monolith

### 🔍 Goals:
- Understand application boundaries
- Identify tight couplings and shared state
- Analyze bottlenecks and ownership

### ✅ Deliverables:
- System architecture diagram
- Domain-driven decomposition
- Critical component analysis

---

## 🧱 2. Define Microservice Candidates

### 🍰 Decomposition Strategies:
- By business capability
- Domain-driven (bounded contexts)
- Strangler Fig pattern (gradual extraction)

### ✅ Tips:
- Start with low-risk, easy-to-isolate modules
- Extract stateless services first

---

## 🧪 3. Containerize the Monolith

- Create Dockerfile for the monolith
- Deploy as a single pod on OpenShift
- Add health checks, resource limits, and logging

### ✅ Benefits:
- Consistent runtime for all future services
- Enables hybrid deployment

---

## 🚀 4. Set Up CI/CD and GitOps

- Use **OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton)** or Jenkins
- Adopt **GitOps with ArgoCD or OpenShift GitOps**
- Integrate security scans (e.g., BlackDuck)

---

## 🔁 5. Implement Observability

- Metrics: Prometheus, Grafana
- Logs: Elasticsearch, Kibana
- Traces: Jaeger

> Track calls between monolith and microservices

---

## 🕸️ 6. Start Extracting Services

- Apply the Strangler Pattern
- Deploy new microservices in parallel
- Redirect traffic incrementally

### Tools:
- OpenShift Service Mesh (Istio)
- 3scale API Gateway

---

## 🔐 7. Handle Shared Data

- Define data ownership
- Move toward database-per-service
- Use views or abstraction layers temporarily

---

## 🔐 8. Secure Microservices

- Use NetworkPolicies, ServiceAccounts, SCCs
- Integrate OpenShift OAuth for user/service access
- Use mTLS with Service Mesh

---

## 🧹 9. Retire the Monolith

- Validate functionality has been migrated
- Decommission or archive the monolith
- Clean up services and configurations

---

## ✅ Summary Approach

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Assess | Understand monolith structure |
| 2. Design | Define microservice boundaries |
| 3. Containerize | Deploy monolith in OpenShift |
| 4. CI/CD | Set up pipelines and GitOps |
| 5. Observability | Add tracing and logging |
| 6. Extract | Use the Strangler Pattern |
| 7. Split Data | Reduce data coupling |
| 8. Secure | Harden inter-service comms |
| 9. Retire | Shut down monolith gradually |
