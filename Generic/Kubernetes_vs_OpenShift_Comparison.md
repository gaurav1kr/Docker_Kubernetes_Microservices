# Kubernetes vs OpenShift ‚Äì Development & Security Comparison

This document outlines the key differences between Kubernetes and OpenShift from a **development** and **security** standpoint, with examples.

---

## üöÄ Development Perspective

| Feature | Kubernetes | OpenShift |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **CLI Tool** | `kubectl` | `oc` (extends `kubectl`) |
| **Web Console** | Requires 3rd-party dashboards | Built-in rich UI for developers and operators |
| **Built-in CI/CD** | Not included by default | Comes with OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton) and Jenkins |
| **Developer Workflows** | Requires custom scripting | `oc new-app`, `oc start-build`, Source-to-Image (S2I) support |
| **Application Templates** | Use Helm or write YAML manually | Built-in templates and OperatorHub |
| **Cloud IDE** | Needs 3rd-party integration | OpenShift DevSpaces (Eclipse Che) |
| **Operator Support** | Supports CRDs and custom controllers | Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) built-in |

### üß™ Example ‚Äì Deploying a Python App

**Kubernetes:**
```bash
kubectl create deployment pyapp --image=python:3.8
kubectl expose deployment pyapp --port=5000 --type=LoadBalancer
```

**OpenShift:**
```bash
oc new-app python:3.8~https://github.com/user/myapp.git
oc expose svc/myapp
```

> `oc new-app` simplifies workflow with Source-to-Image (S2I) builds.

## üîê Security Perspective

| Feature | Kubernetes | OpenShift |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Pod Security** | PodSecurity Admission / PSP (deprecated) | Security Context Constraints (SCCs) |
| **Default User Context** | Containers may run as root | Enforces non-root UID by default |
| **Image Policy Enforcement** | Requires manual tools | Native image signature validation |
| **RBAC** | Needs manual setup | Predefined roles and project-based access |
| **OAuth Integration** | Requires manual OIDC setup | Built-in OAuth with LDAP, GitHub, Google support |
| **Network Security** | NetworkPolicy supported | Plus native SDN firewall and egress control |
| **Compliance Tools** | Needs additional tools | Built-in Compliance Operator, audit logging |

### üõ°Ô∏è Example ‚Äì Running a Container as Root

**Kubernetes:**
```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
```

**OpenShift:**
If you try to run a container as root without permission:
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - image: some-root-image
```
üî¥ It will be **denied by SCC** unless the image is pre-approved.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Area | OpenShift Advantage |
|------|---------------------|
| Development UX | Developer-friendly tools, S2I, web UI |
| CI/CD | Out-of-the-box Pipelines & Jenkins |
| Security | Enforced non-root, SCCs, image validation |
| Enterprise Ready | OAuth, compliance, RBAC, operator lifecycle |
